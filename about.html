			<p class="name">Bettie Resse</p>
			<p>I'm Bettie and I'm 14 years old.  I attend Detroit School of Arts. My favorite memory in my neighborhood is the park, because I used to be there a lot when I was younger, with my siblings. I still love my community very much, and when I become a superstar I will give back to my community. I believe the park and the candy shop are very important to me, or are a main factor in my community because like I said, I grew up there and I knew everyone on my street. The reason for me being in this program is because adults told me about it, and I realized it was fun and very funny here.
